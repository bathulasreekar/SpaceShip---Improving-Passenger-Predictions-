    "1.- The way we clean our data influences a lot the prediction for passengers. We developed our model using the average in general but once our score plateaued, we moved on to other methods. In this case, using a fast and simple way of filling in the missing values was quite effective. Compared to using mean or median, we decided to use the 'ffill' method. Ultimately, we jumped 5% in the Kaggle score just by changing the way we handle missing values.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2.-From all the variables, the use of cryosleep was the one with a higher correlation. This means that those passengers had a higher chance of getting transported compared to those awake. Only 35% of passengers decided to use this method during the trip but those who did avoid getting lost in a different dimension. Additionally, those passengers who didn't ask for room service also had more changed of reaching their destination which is related to cryosleep since a person sleeping cant order food.  For future trip, it would be recommended to passengers to take cryosleep always when it is possible for them<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3.-The most effective machine learning model for the team approach was the use of a Histogram Gradient Boosting Classifier. This is an upgraded version of the basic Gradient Boosting Classifier that was tuned to have the highest accuracy possible. In this particular case, having a smaller gap between the Train and Test sets resulted in worst performance than having a smaller gap. In order to further improve the model, better tuning is required adding more parameters to the hyper tuning. Overall, getting an accuracy score higher than 0.81 will result in better and better placement in the competition.<br><br>  \n"

The outcomes should be based on the demographics, ticket information and from which spot of the spaceship they were teleported. Participants are provided with a dataset containing information about each passenger, such as their age, gender, class, and whether they were transported or not to an alternate dimension. <br><br>\n",
    "Using this dataset, participants create machine learning models that can predict whether a passenger was teleported or not. The competition provides an opportunity for data science beginners to practice their skills and for experienced practitioners to test their models against others in the community.

    "While creating new features or columns with information, the team started by transforming the information that was already existing in the dataset but structuring it in a way that the machine learning models were able to leverage it. This is called “One hot encoding” (w3schools) and in this way, we are able to get new numerical information from a column that previously was just text. As an example, we separated the “home planet” into 3 new columns (Earth, Mars, Europa). if the passenger came from any of these destinations then we get a 1 or 0 instead of just the name. Finally, we got 21 columns in total compared to the previous 14."

The final result was a model with an accuracy of 81%, having a moderated gap between the train and the validation of just 5%. In other words, it was a model that performed well and was stable enough for us to keep testing."

    "The confusion matrix provides insight into the model's performance by comparing actual and predicted transported passengers. In this case, the model correctly identified 917 passengers as transported and 830 as not transported, but misclassified 178 passengers as transported when they were actually not transported and 249 passengers as not transported when they were actually transported. Based on this, the model's performance can be evaluated using metrics additional to accuracy, such as precision and recall. In general, the split between passengers transported and not transported is divided between 52% transported and 48 not transported."

    "The computed kappa value of 0.606 indicates substantial agreement between the predicted and actual target values beyond what would be expected by chance. Kappa is a measure of inter-rater agreement that takes into account the possibility of agreement occurring by chance alone. A value of 1 indicates perfect agreement, while a value of 0 indicates agreement no better than chance. Therefore, a kappa value of 0.606 is considered to be a good measure of agreement between the predicted and actual target values."

The specificity of 0.77 and sensitivity of 0.84 suggest that the model is able to predict negative and positive cases with moderate accuracy. The kappa score of 0.60 indicates substantial agreement between the predicted and actual classes. Overall, the model seems to be performing well, but further analysis may be necessary to improve its predictive power.**"
